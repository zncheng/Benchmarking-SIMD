# Benchmarking-SIMD

This is a simple example to show SIMD gains.
I try to use SIMD to improve the performance of the system I am currently working on.
However, I find there are many different instruction sets in my platform. 
As a freshman, I was unable to catch the right one.
I decide to simply benchmark these different instruction sets based on the workload I need so I can have the best choices.

## SIMD basic
You can find the SIMD concept [here](http://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/vakken/magr/2017-2018/files/SIMD%20Tutorial.pdf)
Basically, SIMD means Single Instruction Multiple Data, which means you can use a single instruction to manipulate multiple pairs of data. 
It is suitable for workloads that needs *for* or *while* loop and have no dependency between target data.
